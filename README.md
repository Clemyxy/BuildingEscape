# BuildingEscape
Toy project to get a hang of Unreal engine

This project is the first part of an Udemy course by Gamedev.Tv (https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)

The goal of this is to have a first look at Unreal's different aspects to create a very basic "game".

## Getting Started

Project made on Unreal 4.22, you can download Unreal on https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/,
Or you can build it from the sources by following this guide https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github.

Once unreal is installed, you can add this project to your projects list and then launch it.

## Playing the game

### Commands

You can interact in this game by using:
W => Forward.
Q => Left.
S => Backward.
D => Right.
Right Mouse Button => Grab an item facing where you aim.
Mouse rotation => Turn your character.
E or SpaceBar => fly upward for a time.

### Goal
![Image Du Jeu](https://github.com/Clemyxy/BuildingEscape/blob/master/Screen%20Building%20Escape.png)

Your goal is to put enough pressure on the pressure plate (Where the purple light is),
which will trigger the opening of the door(WARNING: Loud sound when it opens).<br/>
To do so, you can move around the object at your disposal.
